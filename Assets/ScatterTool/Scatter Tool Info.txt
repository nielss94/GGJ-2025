Current Version : 1.0

_________________________________________________________________

- Features -

Made specifically for Edit Mode
Supports one or more selected objects, in the same or different scenes. 
Spawn the selected objects randomly or in order
Full support for Undo-Redo after or during simulation
Rigidbody is not required. Current colliders will be used
Posibility to keep hierarchy position
Can spawn randomly on a circular area
Able to spawn after slept or after a configurable time delay
Change height from which objects are spawned

_________________________________________________________________

- Supported Objects -

Regular Game Objects in the scene (even cameras, lights, etc)
Asset Prefabs in the project view
Prefabs instanced in the scene. All parameter changes, added or removed objects, and added or removed components (overrides) are kept.

_________________________________________________________________

- Restricted cases (to avoid bad simulation results) -

Parts of a prefab. Its root object will be always selected instead
Objects with Rigidbodies down in the hierarchy (not the root), as discouraged by Unity
Objects with non-convex mesh colliders. They cannot be simulated since Unity 5
Instanced prefabs that contain objects added as overrides with added objects as overrides on them too (small plus icon on them)

_________________________________________________________________

- How to use -

1) Enable it using the custom tool dropdown button in the main toolbar (next to Move, Rotate...) 
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingCustomEditorTools.html

2) A little window will popup in the Scene View that you can drag and drop

3) Have one or more objects selected in the hierarchy or in the project view. If any unallowed object 
is selected, an error will be displayed in the tool

5) Change spawn settings in the tool GUI in the scene view if needed

6) Left Click once or hold it to keep dropping objects. Simulation will stop when all of the simulated 
objects are asleep, otherwise move the mouse out of the scene view or press "Stop Simulation" in the tool GUI.

_________________________________________________________________

- Warning -

This tool doesn't bake objects into a single mesh at the moment. Please use any of the awesome baking tools 
available in the Asset Store (Bakery, Mesh Baker, Total Baker...)

Since changes happen in your scene before and after simulating the objects, I strongly suggest to use version 
control software (Git, SVN, PlasticSCM...), in case the tool fails because of an unexpected bug you will be 
able to recover the previous state.

_________________________________________________________________

- Under-the-hood details -

Due to engine's limitations, the tool modifies the status of the rigidbodies in the scene before 
the simulation process starts and keeps track of all changes. Then parameters and overrides in 
prefabs are restored afterwards, even when rigidbodies had overrides beforehand.

Objects with no colliders will not collide with any object when simulating. At the moment no 
collider is created and is an upcoming feature.

If selected objects to spawn are taken from different loaded scenes, the spawned copies of each 
will respect the origin of each of them and collide only with the colliders on each scene.
